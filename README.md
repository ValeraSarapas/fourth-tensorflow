# forth-tensorflow
Forth attempt at making tensorflow easier for windows users by loading working examples onto http://c9.io  (cloud9)

.



Update Oct19, 2016

Just finally got a deeplearning model working from a webbrowser. shut down notebook and run keras-serve.php in the keras-php-server folder. then load the keras-serve.html file and submit the form request to the keras-serve.py python program. Results get displayed in the web browser all at once so you have a bit of a wait to get the data.


Update Oct14, 2016.

Entered new 0.11 verison of tensorflow. Presently this is still a really long installation. Takes about 1 hour on cloud9. 

Update May 10, 2016

Moved setup files to the drafts location until they are ready to be integrated into the main setup.sh file. Look there for any GPU, torch, Open-Al-Gym setups.
